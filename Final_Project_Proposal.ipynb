    "The dataset consists of 541 rows and 45 columns. It contains patients' age, weight, height, endometrial thickness, waist:hip ratio, specific hormones and so on. The data is collected from 10 different hospital across Kerala, India.\n",

    "This dataset contains ultrasound images of patients with PCOS and normal patients. Each image in the dataset has been categorized into PCOS and Normal classes, which are annotations from specialist doctors.\n",

    "## Description of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A uniform definition of PCOS does not exist, in large part because of its diverse and heterogeneous nature[1]. The general agreement is that PCOS is an ovarian dysfunction syndrome of which the main features are hyperandrogenism and an ultrasound appearance of polycystic ovaries (PCO)[2]. PCOS remains a syndrome and, as such, no single diagnostic criterion (such as hyperandrogenism or PCO) is sufficient for clinical diagnosis. Its clinical manifestations may include: menstrual irregularities, signs of androgen excess, and obesity. Insulin resistance and elevated serum LH levels are also common features in PCOS[3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "PCOS diagnosed by ultrasound and blood tests. The goal of this project is to find which aspect is mostly related to PCOS and to build two machine learning models for PCOS detection and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most common way to diagnose PCOS is looking if patient meets at least 2 of the following 3 criteria:\n",
    "- irregular periods or infrequent periods(no regular ovulation)\n",
    "- blood tests showing high levels of \"male hormones\", such as testosterone (or sometimes just the signs of excess male hormones, even if the blood test is normal)\n",
    "- scans showing polycystic ovaries[4]\n",
    "Probably these features are highly correlated. I will search relations between them. And also I will check if they are the best criteria for determine whether patient has PCOS or not.\n",

    "### Project Pieces\n",
    "- First Model\n",
    "    - First, I will try to understand and prepare dataset for the next step. Second step is visualize the data and look for patterns in the data. In the third step I will search if there are correlations between features. Then I will split the data to train and test sets. The last step is to try to fit different classifier models(KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression) and compare them to find which one is the best.\n",
    "- Second Model\n",
    "    - For this model, first thing I need to do is merge second and third datasets. After that, I will again try to understand and prepare the dataset(if needed) by resizing, converting to grayscale, flipping, rotating etc. In the next step, I will try to extract essential features of follicles. My goal is to find the image has PCOS or not. Therefore, I will again use classification models. Lastly, I will compare the models and decide which one is the best.\n",
